✨**AllerLens-Allergy-Ingredient-Checker**

AllerLens is a smart project designed to detect allergy-causing ingredients in products by simply uploading an image of the ingredient list. Whether it’s food, cosmetics, or supplements  AllerLens lets you know what to avoid.

🔍***What It Does***

🖼️ Scans Product Labels: Upload images of ingredient lists directly from packaging

🔠 Extracts Text: Uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract ingredient names

⚠️ Detects Allergens: Flags ingredients that match your personal allergy list

➕ Add Custom Allergens: Add ingredients you're allergic to — once stored, they stay

🔁 Quick Reset: Easily reset inputs, image, and results for new scans

🧠***How It Works***
Upload an image of an ingredient label

Extracted text is compared against stored allergens

Any matches are flagged and shown clearly

You can add allergens any time — no image required

Duplicate entries and results are automatically removed
